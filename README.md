# Mentor System

## How does it work?
Members of a certain ULX group may promote and assign Helpers to themself. This is essentially a way for certain Staff members to track the command and chat logs of new Staff. Having a more experienced admin watch over them allows them to **mentor** them and ensure that they will be a good fit for Staff.
