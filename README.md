# Mentor System
This is a fairly small addon that I created for [my upcoming server](https://anonttt.com), but released it publicly in case anyone else would like to use it in their servers.

## How does it work?
Members of a certain ULX group, my server uses `senioradmin` (this is a hard-coded value, if you want to change it you can modify in `cl_assign.lua`) may promote and assign Helpers to themself (again, a hard-coded value in `sv_assign.lua`). This is essentially a way for certain Staff members to track the command and chat logs of new Staff. On my server, being a "Helper" is not considered Staff, but have *limited* administrative power (such as muting/gagging and limited aslay), and is the first stepping stone to becoming an Operator. Having a superior watch over them allows them to **mentor** them and ensure that they will be a good fit for Staff.
